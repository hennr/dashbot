# dashbot

Simple dashboard - don't use it, cause it's not ready at all.

## Run it
```
$ bower install
$ npm install
$ grunt serve
```

## Notes
For polling other than local URLs (like in the example) start up your browser with disabled security, i.e. Chrome with:

```
$ open -a Google\ Chrome --args --disable-web-security
```
